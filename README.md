# Git Intro Lesson for CSIRO Data School 2024+

Introduction to Git for version control, with examples using BitBucket online repositories.  
  
This lesson started as a port of an older lesson, with its own history, here:  
https://github.com/csiro-data-school/git-intro-23  
to the newer
[Software Carpentries visual template](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/index.html).
However, this repository starts as a fork of the new template, rather than the old lesson version.
