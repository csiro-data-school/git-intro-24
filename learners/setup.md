title: Setup
---

You will need a terminal with Git. For Windows users, you may like to make use of 
[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), which is also available through the software centre
(as simply 'Git').  Mac and Linux users should already be good to go without any additional setup.  

You will also need a Bitbucket account, which you can create at 
[https://bitbucket.csiro.au/](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/).
